* Forgive the Go
This talk will be using a programing language called Go.  
Go is a great language, but for the material covered here, petend there are semi-colins at the end of each line, and it's the same thing...

* Welcome computer scientists
Wait, what is a computer?

"A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem." - Wikipedia

* Welcome computer scientists
Wait, what is science?

"Science (from Latin scientia, meaning "knowledge"[1]) is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3][4] In an older and closely related meaning, "science" also refers to a body of knowledge itself, of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied. A practitioner of science is known as a scientist." - Wikipedia

* What does this mean?

* On clever code

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." â€” Brian Kernighan

* A clever example

* Not so clever

* Naming

"There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors." - Phil Karlton (partially)
